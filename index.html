        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Jay-Jay Okocha's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1973</strong> born in Enugu, Enugu State, Nigeria</li>
            <li><strong>1990</strong> had a glimpse of limelight when the local club Enugu Rangers signed him</li>
            <li><strong>1991</strong> joined Eintracht Frankfurt, and continued to showcase his rare talent 
                and skills there. He scored the goal of the season against goalkeeping legend Oliver Kahn, 
                after manoeuvring past several players.</li>
            <li><strong>1995</strong> transferred to Turkish top division side Fernabahce for a few of 1 million pounds.
                 During his spell at the club, he racked up 30 goals in 62 appearances, mostly direct free kick goals.
                  He became synonymous with spot kick goals. 
                  He was given a Turkish citizenship during his time at the club.</li>
            <li><strong>1998</strong> Paris Saint Germaine splashed out 14 million pounds on the Nigerian midfielder
                 making him Africa's most expensive player that year. He spent four years at the French capital, 
                 making 84 appearances and scoring 12 goals.</li>
            <li><strong>2002</strong>joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer. The euphoria of his first season at
                 the club was dampened by prolonged injuries, despite this setback, the Nigerian footballer helped save
                  his side from relegation by scoring seven crucial goals. </li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> Okocha was given the captain role and arm band following his continued display 
                of passion and leadership. </li>
            <li><strong>2006</strong> moved onto Qatar after rejecting a contract extension offer from Bolton Wanderers.</li>
            <li><strong>2007</strong> returned to England after one year in Qatar to join Hull City on a free transfer
                . He was a member of the team that won promotion to the premier league after countless attempts in 104
                 years.</li>
            <li><strong>2008</strong>retired at the end of the season due to prolonged injuries and fitness concerns</li>
            <li><strong>2015</strong> Okocha was voted as the Chairman of Delta State Football Association.</li>
